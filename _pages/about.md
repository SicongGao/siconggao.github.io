I am a remote sensing researcher specializing in terrestrial ecosystem analysis, with a focus on understanding the complex interactions between vegetation dynamics and environmental processes. My research integrates advanced remote sensing technologies with ecological modeling to quantify and monitor ecosystem functions across diverse landscapes. My work centers on several interconnected research areas, including the development and application of radiative transfer models for interpreting optical remote sensing data, analysis of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a proxy for photosynthetic activity, and investigation of evapotranspiration processes using satellite-based observations and modeling approaches.

A significant component of my research focuses on Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems (GDEs), where I examine the intricate relationships between groundwater availability and vegetation water demand in water-limited environments. My GDE research specifically investigates woody  vegetation responses to hydrological stress, including drought conditions and the implementation of environmental flow management strategies. Through the integration of remote sensing observations with hydrological modeling, I assess how changes in groundwater levels and surface water availability influence ecosystem structure, function, and resilience. This work contributes to understanding the vulnerability of GDEs to climate variability and anthropogenic water management practices, providing critical insights for the sustainable management and conservation of these ecologically important systems.
